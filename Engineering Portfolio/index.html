                        For my senior project, myself and three other Cal Poly fourth-year mechanical engineering students were sponsored by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.<br>
                        <br>
                        We collaborated directly with representatives from the LLNL Independent Diagnostic Scoring System (LIDSS) team to design, build, and test a prototype of a new battery tray enclosure for ocean-going autonomous rafts.<br>
                        The previous housing for the raft’s batteries was sub-optimal. Its open-air frame meant that the batteries had experienced corrosion issues and fouling. Additionally, LIDSS wanted to use a new battery monitoring system (BMS) on the rafts which would not work in the existing housing. Our job was to re-design the raft’s battery housing such that it could be retrofitted onto the current rafts, it was easily accessible, it protected the batteries from corrosion, and it was strong enough to support the weight of the raft.<br>
                        <br>
                        Our solution is constructed from CNC-cut aluminum sheet metal which we bent and welded together, aluminum angle stock, custom rubber gaskets, and stainless steel fasteners. Our design centers around ingress protection and corrosion resistance, while remaining relatively lightweight and allowing for ease-of-maintenance.<br>
                        <br>
                        From this project, I learned a lot about the importance of incorporating DFM priciples early in the development phase. I also became much better at welding aluminum than I ever thought that I would be!<br>

                        The project was a great success, and we were able to deliver a prototype that met all of LIDSS’s requirements. We presented our work at the Cal Poly Mechanical Engineering Senior Project Expo in June 2025, where we received positive feedback from both faculty and industry representatives.

                        In my combustion engine design class during my last quarter at Cal Poly, I completed a project in which I converted a Honda GX690 spark-ignition gasoline engine to run on propane (C₃H₈) and compressed natural gas (CNG, CH₄). The project also involved hooking the engine up to a Magtrol dynamometer to measure its performance after sustaining combustion on each alternative fuel. On the dyno, air-fuel mixture was adjusted to maximize output power and performance mapping generated complete power and torque curves and demonstrated smooth combustion and stable operation.<br>
                        <br>
                        The results indicated that propane conversion of small engines is both practical and repeatable when fuel‐regulator settings are tightly controlled. CNG operation requires enhanced pressure regulation and robust infrastructure to overcome storage density limitations but is extremely economical especially compared to gasoline.<br>
                        <br>
                        This project was a rewarding exercise in overcoming the challenges of engine tuning/modification and producing power using gas-phase fuels on an engine without fuel injection. It required us to solve critical problems on an extremely fast timeframe, like when I manufactured a custom aluminum shaft key for the coupler that mated the engine shaft and dyno shaft.
