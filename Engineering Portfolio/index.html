                    <p>
                        For my senior project, myself and three other Cal Poly fourth-year mechanical engineering students were sponsored by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.<br>
                        <br>
                        We are collaborating directly with representatives from the LLNL Independent Diagnostic Scoring System (LIDSS) team to design, build, and test a prototype of a new battery tray enclosure for ocean-going autonomous rafts.<br>
                        The current housing for the raft’s batteries is sub-optimal. Its open-air frame means the batteries have experienced corrosion issues and fouling. Additionally, LIDSS wants to use a new battery monitoring system (BMS) on the rafts which will not work in the current housing. Our job is to re-design the raft’s battery housing such that it can be retrofitted onto the current rafts, is easily accessible, protects the batteries from corrosion, and is strong enough to support the weight of the raft.<br>
                        <br>
                        As of February 2025 we have finalized our design after many iterations and design reviews. Manufacturing is next!
