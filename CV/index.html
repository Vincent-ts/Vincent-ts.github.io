                        During the summer of 2024, I interned on the mechanical engineering team at Interface Engineering in downtown San Francisco for ten weeks. 
                        During this time, I got the opportunity to learn CAD software like AutoCAD and Revit, and HVAC software like Trace 700 for heating and cooling load calculations. I was also able to attend various site visits with the team at projects around the Bay Area.<br>
                        <br>
                        For one small project at UCSF’s Parnassus Heights campus, I personally designed the routing of new ductwork that was to be constructed.

                        During the summer of 2022, I worked at Valvoline Instant Oil Change in San Francisco’s SOMA district. This job allowed me to obtain tons of experience working on cars, which is something that I still enjoy doing.<br>
                        <br>
                        I also feel that my hands-on experience here helped me to better understand the engineering design of not just cars but all mechanical systems.
