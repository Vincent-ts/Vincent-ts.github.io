                        This project was a great application of basic CAD skills in SOLIDWORKS. I uploaded my drawing file to the company SendCutSend online, and a week later I had the laser-cut steel frame in my hand. From there I powder coated it in the Cal Poly Machine Shops. The finished product really came out great and it remains on my car to this day.

                        During my 4th year at Cal Poly, I took an advanced casting class as a technical elective. We did many interesting casting projects in that class but the coolest was the final project. For the final project we were able to cast whatever we wanted to, using whichever casting method that we preferred.  <br>
                        <br>
                        I chose to cast a golf putter head out of brass, using the shell-investment process. I designed my putter head based on the Ping Anser and modeled it in SOLIDWORKS. Once I had refined my design, I worked on a downsprue and gating system. I ran a CFD and solidification analysis of the casting using a software called Solidcast, the results of which are in the video below. I used the analysis results to position the gating system in a way that minimized porosity and allowed for smooth directional solidification in the finished part. <br>
                        <br>
                        Finally, I 3D printed the putter head and its attached gating system from PLA and then began the shell-investment process, dipping the whole part in ceramic slurry and silica sand to build up a thick outer shell. Eventually, the pattern was melted out and I poured brass into the mold, resulting in an attractive prototype.

                        In the Spring of 2024, while I was home for a week for spring break, I stumbled upon a deal that I couldn’t resist on Facebook Marketplace. A vintage Bianchi road bike in my perfect size, for just $150. I came across the post within 30 minutes of it being uploaded. Knowing that it wouldn’t last long at all, I immediately contacted the seller and told them that I was willing to pay the listed price and pick the bike up in just a couple hours. <br>
                        <br>
                        I hopped in my car and headed all the way up past Petaluma, CA to secure the deal. The bike had clearly been neglected for a while, but I spent the rest of that spring break cleaning, restoring, upgrading, and retrofitting new components to it. <br>
                        <br>
                        Since then I have been riding this bike to Cal Poly everyday as my commuter in SLO, and to work during the summer of 2024.

                        This website that you are viewing right now is something that I coded myself. In high school I took a web design class which focused on basic HTML and CSS.<br>
                        <br>
                        When I decided to create a personal portfolio, I thought why not put those skills to use. I took on the challenge and enjoyed the process of refamiliarizing myself with coding websites. Artificial intelligence tools have made web development a whole lot easier than it was (even just 5 years ago) when I took that class, but it certainly helped to have that foundation of knowledge to build upon and troubleshoot problems.
